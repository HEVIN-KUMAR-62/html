            <h1>What is Coaching?</h1>
            <p>There are a few different definitions of coaching, and this can depend on the type of coaching you seek and the reason for seeking it. Some popular definitions include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is helping them learn rather than teaching them.</li><br>
            <li>Unlocking a person’s potential to maximize their own performance.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>People who undertake the role of coaching often refer to themselves as a Life Coach, usually with a specific area of life or professional development that they specialize in. The Cambridge Dictionary defines a life coach as:

                ‘someone who helps clients decide what they want in their life and how to achieve it.’
                
                Simply put, coaching is the relationship between two individuals, one as the coach and one as the ‘client’. People may engage with a life coach or seek out coaching for many different aspects of life including:</p>
                <h1>Is Coaching the Same as Therapy?</h1>
                <p>Coaching is very different from counseling and clinical therapy.
                   Therapy will usually support a person with different mental or emotional health conditions, in order to help them manage their experiences.
                   Therapy also helps individuals to work through past trauma from a specific incident or experience in their lives, such as the loss of a loved one
                </p>
                <h3>Other key differences include</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>  To practice as a therapist or counselor requires professional degrees and qualifications, as well as registration with professional bodies, and relevant professional licenses. It is a much more highly-skilled profession, compared with coaching (not to say that coaching isn’t equally valuable to the right individual).</li>
                   <li> Therapy and/or counseling usually reflect on past experiences and how they influence the present. Coaching is more focused on supporting the present in order to create a more positive future (Robbins, 2019).</li>
                   <li> Coaching has a focus on more direct, attainable goals, and the tangible steps required to achieve them. Therapy and counseling are less outcomes focused, with an emphasis on ‘inner’ subconscious and conscious personal development (Stephens, 2018).</li>
                 <li>   Therapy and counseling can take place over many years, for as long as the individual feels they require it or for as long as the relationship is helping them. Coaching tends to be shorter term due to the outcomes focus of the relationship (Stephens, 2018)</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>A Look at Coaching for Children</h1>
                <p>When it comes to coaching for children, the best person for the job is almost always the parents (Baras, 2019).<br>
                    A large part of parenting is supporting children to reach their potential, uncover what their passions and goals might be, and help them work towards different avenues of success in ways that are meaningful.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Resilience</li>
<li>Overcoming failure</li>
<li>Confidence in going after what they want</li>
<li>Creative problem-solving</li>
<li>An open and curious approach to new challenges and ideas</li>
<li>Collaboration and sharing</li>
                    </ul>
    <h1>What is Emotion Coaching for Children?</h1>
    <p>Emotion Coaching is an area of relationship psychology focused specifically on coaching young people for emotional, social and wellbeing confidence.

        Emotion coaching places an emphasis on helping children to understand and regulate their emotional reactions, rather than attempting to get them to change their behavior through reward and punishment systems (Gottman, Katz & Hoover, 1996).
        
        Using reward and punishment systems can work with children in the short term, but research has shown that over time these models of coercing behavior become increasingly ineffective (Bloom, 2009).
        
        Emotion coaching is far more beneficial as it helps children to understand the vastness of their emotions, why they might happen, and how to communicate and overcome them (Weare & Gray, 2003).
        </p>
        <h3>The Emotion Coaching technique is comprised of two elements:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Empathy – This requires the parent to suspend any reaction to the behavior a child may display, and instead focus on the emotions they exhibit. In this part of the coaching, it is important to help the child recognize and label their emotional reactions, to help them build their understanding of their emotions.
                </li>
        <li>Guidance – The second part of the coaching model requires guidance in explaining why the emotions have arisen. Depending on the situation, limits can still be applied to the behavior (for example, making the child take a time-out as a consequence of poor behavior), but the focus should be on guiding the child through why they have behaved the way they have (in response to an emotion) and why the time-out is being applied as a consequence.
