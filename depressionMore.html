We all have times when we feel sad, but depression is something that affects your daily life, making it hard to find enjoyment in day-to-day activities. We take a look at what depression is, its causes, and how counselling/therapy can help.</p>

<h1>What is depression?</h1>
<p>Depression is a mood disorder that can take many forms: some days you may find it impossible to get out of bed, while other days you may feel more able to go about your normal daily tasks. Living with depression can be incredibly difficult, both for those suffering and those around them. Due to the nature of the condition, however, seeking help can often be delayed.</p>

<h1>Do I have depression?</h1>
<p>For some, an obstacle to them seeking help is understanding whether or not they actually have depression. Before we go into the symptoms of depression, it's important to point out that if you are struggling with your emotions and feel unable to cope, it could be worth seeking support. You are worthy of help, no matter how trivial you may perceive your problems to be.</p>

<h1>What does depression feel like?</h1>
<p>If you have depression, you are likely to have at least five of the following symptoms.</p>

<h3>You may feel:</h3>
<ul>
<li>worthless</li>
<li>like life isn’t worth living</li>
<li>constantly anxious, tearful and worried</li>
<li>like you can’t concentrate</li>
<li>indecisive</li>
<li>irritable and intolerant of others</li>
<li>you are not getting enough enjoyment out of life</li>
<li>you have a lack of self-esteem</li>
<li>you have excessive and inappropriate guilt</li>
<li>you have no motivation or interest in things you used to enjoy</li>
</ul>
<h3>You may experience:</h3>
<ul>
<li>changes in sleeping patterns - broken nights or oversleeping</li>
<li>changes in eating patterns - loss of appetite or overeating</li>
<li>tiredness and a loss of energy</li>
<li>persistent headaches and/or stomach upsets</li>
<li>chronic pain</li>
<li>a slower speaking pattern than usual</li>
<li>loss of libido</li>
<li>changes to the menstrual cycle</li>
</ul>
<h3>You may also:</h3>
<ul>
<li>neglect hobbies and interests</li>
<li>isolate yourself from friends and family</li>
<li>take part in fewer social activities</li>
<li>notice your productivity falling at work</li>
</ul>
<p>In some circumstances, you might not even notice that you have developed depression, especially if it has been a gradual process over several weeks or months. Sometimes it takes a friend, a family member or a partner to point out that you may have a problem.</p>
<hr>

<h1>Why do we become depressed?</h1>
<p>Sometimes it’s instantly apparent what the cause is, but other times there isn’t an obvious reason why you feel so down. It could be that you’ve lost something or someone, or it could stem from disappointment or frustration. Usually, there will be more than one reason why you suffer from depression, and these reasons differ from person to person.</p>

<h3 style="color: darkgrey;">Common reasons behind the development of depression include:</h3>

<h3>Distressing life events</h3>
<p>Distressing life events can take their toll on us. Divorce, family problems or losing a job are all momentous in our lives that can alter our mood.</p>

<h3>Bereavement</h3>
<p>Losing someone close to you can increase the risk. It’s not always just the loss that causes depression, it’s the way we deal with it. If you don’t grieve or express your feelings properly, they can build up and contribute to depression.</p>

<h3>Childhood experiences</h3>
<p>Your childhood experiences can affect you in adult life. If you were physically or emotionally abused, or not taught to cope with troubles that enter your life, it could lead you to have problems as you grow up.</p>

<h3>Anger</h3>
<p>‘Frozen anger’ is a term that’s closely related to depression. You may have gone through something that caused you to become angry, but at the time you couldn’t express your feelings properly. This type of anger becomes suppressed; it can then build up and become a cause of depression.</p>

<h3>Circumstances</h3>
<p>
Feeling like you’re alone, stressed, physically exhausted and/or have no one to talk to can all contribute to the condition.</p>

<h3>Alcohol</h3>
<p>
Regular heavy drinking can make you more susceptible to developing depression.</p>

<h3>Physical illness</h3>
<p>Some types of physical illness can make people more prone to depression:</p>

<p>hormonal problems, e.g. an underactive thyroid
viral infections, e.g. glandular fever or flu (prevalent in younger people)
painful or lasting illnesses, e.g. arthritis
life-threatening conditions, e.g. heart disease and cancer
chronic conditions, e.g. diabetes and epilepsy</p>
